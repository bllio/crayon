# Crayon

A minimalistic online drawing app.

## Background

I primarily started this project to learn about state management in [React][react] using [Zustand][zustand]. It utilizes the [HTML5 Canvas API][canvas] for the main drawing area.

## Features

- Pencil tool for drawing.
- Right click to clear the canvas (might change to a keybind later).

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
